We will implement sub-options **1 to 4**.\r\n\r\n## Task 1: Improve performance of BVH construction\r\n\r\nWe would improve the BVH construction process by refering to \r\n[_Fast Parallel Construction of High-Quality Bounding Volume Hierarchies_](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/fast-parallel-construction-high-quality-bounding-volume-hierarchies). We would implement the method in the previous system for assignment 3.\r\n\r\nWe would conduct evaluation on the system to compare the efficiency before and after the improvement.\r\n\r\n##Task 2: Improve performance of ray tracing\r\n\r\nWe would refer to [Ray Tracing Deformable Scenes using\r\nDynamic Bounding Volume Hierarchies](http://graphics.stanford.edu/%7Eboulos/papers/togbvh.pdf) and implement the fast packet-based ray tracing using. \r\n\r\nWe would conduct evaluation on the system to compare the efficiency before and after the improvement.\r\n\r\n## Task 3: Implement an advanced global sampling algorithm.\r\n\r\nWe would like to implement **bidirectional path tracing** to help find the best paths and reduce the cost. Maybe We will consider using parallel computing skills to further improve the efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to output the variance of the estimator and the total time cost, and make a comparison with the old routine.\r\n\r\nWe may refer to the _PBRT_ book for details about the algorithm.\r\n\r\n## Task 4: Improved sampling patterns.\r\n\r\nWe would use **blue noise** (maybe **adaptive blue noise**) and **stratified sampling** to improve the sampling pattern. We will compare the estimated variance of the estimator and the time consumption.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
